You will have 9 tries to guess the letter that the computer is thinking of. From A to Z.

Start by clicking on any random letter.

The letters you guess will be listed beside "Your guesses so Far."

The number of guesses you have left is indicated beside "Guesses left."

If you guess the correct letter then you win!

If you do not guess the correct letter by the end of your number of guesses then you lose.

The game will keep track of your wins and losses.

At the end of each round the letter that the computer was thinking of will be displayed.

When you are ready to play again click another random letter.
